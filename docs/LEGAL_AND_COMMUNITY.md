# 🏛️ Legal & Community Setup Guide

## Legal Considerations

### Why Legal Structure Matters

DAOs operate in a legal grey area. Without proper structure:
- ❌ Members may have unlimited personal liability
- ❌ DAO may not be able to sign contracts
- ❌ Tax treatment is unclear
- ❌ Regulatory compliance is difficult
- ❌ Banking and fiat operations are impossible

### Legal Wrapper Options

- US tax obligations

**Cost:** $100-500 setup + $60/year  
**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks

**How to Set Up:**
1. Visit https://sos.wyo.gov/

### Recommendation

**For Small DAOs (<$100k treasury):**
